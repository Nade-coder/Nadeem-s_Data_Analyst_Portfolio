      - **Project Overview**:
        In this project, I analyzed a dataset where City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer                 revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us           to offer thorough business advice to address this problem..
      -  **Data Collection**:
        The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, which included information about hotel bookings, calcellations, average daily rate and more.
      - **Data Cleaning**:
        I preprocessed the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types. I used Pandas for these operations.
      - **Descriptive and Exploratory Data Analysis**:
        I performed descriptive and exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
      - **Findings**:
        1. We found that for city hotels, high adr leads to higher cancellations and Longer lead time are leading to more cancellations in resort hotels.
        2. Portugal has the highest number of cancellations.
        3. 47% booking from online medium.
        and more.
