## 2. **Python Projects**
  - ### [Project 1 - Hotel Bookings](https://github.com/Nade-coder/Nadeem-s_Data_Analyst_portfolio/blob/main/Python%20Projects/Project%201%20-%20Hotel%20Bookings/Hotel%20Bookings.ipynb)

      - **Project Overview**:
        In this project, I analyzed a dataset where City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer                 revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us           to offer thorough business advice to address this problem..
      -  **Data Collection**:
        The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, which included information about hotel bookings, calcellations, average daily rate and more.
      - **Data Cleaning**:
        I preprocessed the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types. I used Pandas for these operations.
      - **Descriptive and Exploratory Data Analysis**:
        I performed descriptive and exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
      - **Findings**:
        We found that for city hotels, high adr leads to higher cancellations and Longer lead time are leading to more cancellations in resort hotels.

    - **Data Collection**:
         The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, which included information about Gross Merchandise Value, Merchant Transactions, Total Transaction, Average Monthly Transacting Users, Registered              Merchants, Payment Devices etc

         1. There is a gradual increase in the Gross Merchandise Value over every quarter.
         2. A correlation between merchant transactions Vs merchant loan volume of 0.93 indicates a very strong positive linear relationship between two variables. It suggests that when the                   transaction volume for a merchant increases, the loan volume for the merchant also tends to increase, and vice versa.
         3. Trend: The red line, merchant loan volume increases from 01-06-2020 to 01-12-2020, then there is a decline from 01-12-2020 to 01-06-2021. From 01-06-2021 there is consistent increase of           merchant loan volume overall.
         4. The Quarter 01-03-2023 generated the highest total revenue.
         5.  quarter 01-09-2022 generated the highest revenue from comsumers.
